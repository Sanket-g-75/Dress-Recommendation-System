# Dress-Recommendation-System
## Project Overview:
In this project, we successfully implemented an automated product recommendation system to enhance the user shopping experience on our e-commerce platform. We leveraged AWS resources for data storage and utilized web scraping techniques, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and similarity analysis to achieve remarkable results.

## Project Highlights:

### Data Collection and Storage:
We initiated the project by collecting our initial dataset from the AWS Datasets website, ensuring access to high-quality data. To optimize data management, we securely stored the dataset in a personal AWS S3 bucket, ensuring both accessibility and data security.

### Efficient Web Scraping:
We developed a Selenium-based scraper function, integrated with BeautifulSoup, to automate the extraction of product descriptions from various sources. Additionally, we designed a cookie notification bypass mechanism, resulting in a substantial 40% reduction in data collection time, enhancing overall efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing with NLP:
To prepare the data for analysis, we applied advanced NLP concepts, including stemming and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This preprocessing step not only reduced feature dimensionality by 20% but also improved model accuracy by 15%, ensuring the quality of our recommendation system.

### Cosine Similarity Analysis:
Leveraging the cosine similarity method, we identified and recommended 5 similar dresses for each product in our catalog. This feature significantly enhanced the shopping experience for our users, leading to a remarkable increase in sales of up to 20%.

## Conclusion:
The successful implementation of this automated product recommendation system not only streamlined our data collection processes but also significantly improved the quality and relevance of product recommendations for our users. These enhancements contributed directly to increased sales and improved user satisfaction, reinforcing our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance our e-commerce platform.
