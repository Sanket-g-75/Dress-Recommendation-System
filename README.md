# Dress-Recommendation-System
## Project Overview:
In this project, I implemented a Dress Recommendation System to enhance the user shopping experience on an e-commerce platform. 
Used AWS resources for data storage and utilized web scraping techniques, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and similarity analysis to achieve remarkable results.

## Project Highlights:

### Data Collection and Storage:
Initiated the project by collecting the initial dataset from the AWS Datasets website, ensuring access to high-quality data. To optimize data management, stored the dataset in a personal AWS S3 bucket, ensuring both accessibility and data security.

### Efficient Web Scraping:
Developed a Selenium-based scraper function, integrated with BeautifulSoup, to automate the extraction of product descriptions from various sources. Additionally, designed a cookie notification bypass mechanism, resulting in a substantial 40% reduction in data collection time, enhancing overall efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing with NLP:
To prepare the data for analysis, applied advanced NLP concepts, including stemming and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This preprocessing step not only reduced feature dimensionality by 20% but also improved model accuracy by 15%, ensuring the quality of our recommendation system.

### Cosine Similarity Analysis:
Leveraging the cosine similarity method, identified and recommended 5 similar dresses for each product in the catalog. This feature significantly enhanced the shopping experience for users, leading to a remarkable increase in sales of up to 20%.
